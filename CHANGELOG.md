# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Ctrl+D / Ctrl+U move half a screen, cursor and viewport together (vim/less style).
- Shift+Up / Shift+Down extend a line selection from where they started, VS Code style, painted
  with the theme's `selection` colour. Any other cursor move, Esc or opening a file clears it.

### Changed

- Shift+Up / Shift+Down no longer jump three lines; Ctrl+D / Ctrl+U cover fast movement.

### Fixed

- Go to definition finds annotated Python assignments (`NAME: Final[int] = ...`).
- Emptying the find query clears the previous highlights and returns to the anchor.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-09-12

### Fixed

- Symbol picker recognises `function` and declarations behind `export`, `pub`, `async` and similar prefixes (TypeScript, JavaScript, Rust `pub fn` were mostly missing).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-12

### Added

- Read-only file viewer with a line-number gutter and soft wrap at pane width.
- Syntax highlighting (syntect, bat syntax set) with tokyonight-moon, shokunin-light,
  shokunin-dark themes.
- CLI: `merl`, `merl DIR`, `merl FILE`, `merl FILE:LINE`, `--theme NAME`, `--version`.
- Project root resolution: the given directory, else the file's git toplevel, else its directory.
- Cursor movement: arrows, Shift+Up/Down (3 lines), Shift+Left/Right (word jump), PgUp/PgDn,
  Home/End, Ctrl+Home/Ctrl+End, with a sticky target column.
- Go to line via `:` or Ctrl+G; `q` and Ctrl+C quit, Esc closes the prompt.
- Status bar showing the path relative to the project root, the cursor position, and the focused pane.
- File tree in the left pane: `t` toggles it, Tab switches focus, Enter opens or expands,
  Left/Right collapse and expand; the tree reveals whatever file is opened.
- Fuzzy file picker (nucleo) on `o` / Ctrl+E, with matched characters highlighted.
- Find in file with smart-case regex: `/` or Ctrl+F searches as you type, `n` / `N` step through
  the matches with wraparound, and every match on screen is highlighted.
- Project search, go to definition (Python, Go), symbols and usages via ripgrep's library crates:
  `s`, `d` / F12, `D`, `u` / Shift+F12.
- Jump history: `[` and `]` walk back and forward through the positions a jump left behind.
- Config file `~/.config/merl/config.toml` with a `theme` key.
- Auto-reload: the open file is re-read when it changes on disk, keeping the cursor, the
  scroll position, the jump history and the find pattern.
- Help overlay on `?`, listing every binding; Esc in normal mode clears the find highlights.
